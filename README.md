imon is a memory-based game where the player must repeat a sequence of colors shown by the computer. Each correct repetition adds a new color to the sequence. The game ends when the player makes a mistake.
This version is built entirely with:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity


How to Play
- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the sequence of flashing colors.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
- Each correct round adds a new color.
- A wrong click ends the game â€” try again!
